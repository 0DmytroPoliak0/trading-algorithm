# Trading Algorithm

A Python-based trading algorithm designed for backtesting and live trading. This repository provides a framework for developing, testing, and executing algorithmic trading strategies with a focus on clear code structure and ease of use.

## Overview

This project implements an automated trading system that:
- **Acquires Data:** Imports historical and/or real-time market data for analysis.
- **Implements Strategy Logic:** Encodes trading strategies based on technical indicators, statistical models, or custom rules.
- **Backtests Strategies:** Simulates trades on historical data to evaluate performance and risk metrics.
- **Facilitates Live Trading:** (Optional) Integrates with brokerage APIs to execute trades in real-time.
- **Manages Risk:** Provides tools to manage position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit levels.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily swap out or modify components (data retrieval, strategy logic, risk management).
- **Backtesting Framework:** Run simulations against historical data to assess strategy performance.
- **Live Trading Ready:** With minimal modifications, integrate with supported brokers for live trading.
- **Extensible:** Designed to allow addition of new strategies and indicators.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**  
- Required packages (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)):
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - requests
  - (Any additional libraries your implementation uses)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0DmytroPoliak0/trading-algorithm.git
   cd trading-algorithm
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Trading Algorithm

- **Backtesting:**

  Execute the backtesting module to simulate your strategy on historical data:

  ```bash
  python backtest.py --config config/backtest_config.json
  ```

- **Live Trading (if applicable):**

  To launch the live trading module (ensure you have configured your broker API keys):

  ```bash
  python live_trade.py --config config/live_config.json
  ```

## Configuration

Adjust the JSON configuration files in the `config/` folder to set parameters such as:
- Data source paths
- Strategy parameters (e.g., moving average periods, threshold values)
- Risk management rules (e.g., stop-loss percentage)
- Broker API keys for live trading
